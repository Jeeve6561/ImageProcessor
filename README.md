# Image Processor

This is a simple Python script that can load .png images into greyscale or color photos using the PIL Image library.
It can also save these .png files to the local directory.

The python script can edit images by applying a particular filter:

1. Inverting a greyscale image
2. Inverting a color image
3. Blurring an image
4. sharpening an image
5. Finds the edges of pieces in an image and saving as a greyscale
6. Carving a seam out of an image (i.e. removing like pixels)
7. Darkening an image
8. Lightening an image
9. Make a color image into only red, blue, or a green photo
